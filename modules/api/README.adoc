= Neo4j Workshop API Module


== Introduction
This module provides a RESTful API for managing workshop databases and users on Neo4j. It includes endpoints for creating users, exporting credentials, and inspecting/deleting entities.
It also has a minimalistic UI for the REST API.

== Building the Docker Image
To build and tag the API image locally:

[source,bash]
----
docker build --no-cache -t neo4j-workshop-api\:local -f Dockerfile .
----

== Pushing to Container Registry
The `tools/push.py` script automates building, tagging, pushing, and updating Terraform variables:



This will:

* read the version from `pytproject.yaml`
* Build and push the image to your GCR registry
* Generate `image_tag.auto.tfvars.json` for Terraform.

== Building the UI for Local Testing
Navigate into the `ui/` directory and run:

[source,bash]
----------
cd ui
yarn install
yarn build
----------

The static assets will be output to `ui/dist/` and served by Flask in local mode.

== Running the API Outside Docker

From the `app/` folder:

[source,bash]
------------------
cd app
python -m app.main
------------------

Ensure `FLASK_ENV` is not set to `production` for dev server mode.

== API Endpoints Overview

* `POST /users` — create (or append) workshop users, returns JSON list of credentials.
* `POST /export` — accept JSON array of credentials, returns CSV (`Accept: text/csv`) or PDF (`Accept: application/pdf`).
* `POST /login` — validate bearer token, returns 200 if valid.
* `GET /users` — list existing workshop users.
* `GET /databases/count` — count of workshop databases.
* `DELETE /user/{username}` — remove a specific workshop user, role, and database.
* `DELETE /users` - delete all users and databases
* `GET /*` — serve React SPA (catch-all).

== Testing with IntelliJ HTTP Client
A sample HTTP client file is provided at `rest/rest-api.http`. Use it to test all endpoints locally with IntelliJ or VSCode REST extensions.
